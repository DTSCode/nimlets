Nimlets
=================

http://nimlets.github.io is a site dedicated to demonstrating standalone snippets of Nim code. So-called "Nimlets" are organized by name and tag. 


Building
========

To build the output artifacts simply run "./build" in the root directory. This will install a virtualenv and a number of packages, build some Nim helpers and result in a directory called "output".


Testing
=======

To test locally, simply cd into the output directory and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
